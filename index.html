        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many adverts highlight “cheap” or “low-cost” credit cards. In practice, the cheapest card for one person
          can be expensive for another. This page explains how to think about total cost instead of just one headline number.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>“Cheap” Depends on How You Use the Card</h2>
      <p>
        A card with no annual fee might look cheap at first glance – but if it has high foreign-exchange (FX) fees,
        high interest rates and few protections, it can still be costly for certain usage patterns.
        Another card with a moderate annual fee could be cheaper overall if it avoids other charges you would otherwise pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why many educational resources focus on <em>total cost of ownership</em> over a year or more:
        fees, interest and value received, not just the price tag of the card itself.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Costs -->
    <section id="costs" class="section">
      <h2>The Main Cost Components of a Credit Card</h2>
      <p>
        When comparing what is “cheapest”, it helps to look at each cost component separately and then combine them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual or monthly fees:</strong>
          the fixed price you pay just to hold the card, even if you rarely use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interest on carried balances:</strong>
          the cost of not paying the full statement balance – often the biggest driver of long-term expense.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Foreign-exchange (FX) fees:</strong>
          extra percentages added when you pay in other currencies, which can quietly add up for travellers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cash advance and ATM fees:</strong>
          additional charges when using the card for cash withdrawals or quasi-cash transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Late-payment and penalty fees:</strong>
          costs triggered by missing due dates or going over the limit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A card that is “cheap” for someone who always pays in full, rarely travels and never uses cash advances
        may be very expensive for someone who keeps a balance or spends a lot in foreign currency.
      </p>

    <!-- Pitfalls -->
    <section id="pitfalls" class="section">
      <h2>Common Pitfalls Behind “Cheapest Card” Marketing</h2>
      <p>Terminology like “cheapest”, “low-cost” or “budget” can hide important details, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Introductory offers that expire:</strong>
          a low or 0% rate for a short period may revert to a much higher rate later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited conditions:</strong>
          a cheap FX rate or fee waiver may apply only in certain countries or up to a small spending cap.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Higher costs in other areas:</strong>
          low annual fees but high cash advance charges, or vice versa.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimum payments:</strong>
          paying only the minimum can stretch a “cheap” balance over many years with significant interest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        CheapestCard.Creditcard does not recommend or rank specific products. It aims to make the cost structure clearer
        so you can use independent comparison tools and issuer documentation more effectively.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How to compare -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How to Compare Total Cost in a Simple Way</h2>
      <p>
        A practical approach is to imagine your own likely card usage for a year and then estimate the cost under
        each card’s terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>List expected spend in local currency and foreign currency.</li>
        <li>Note whether you expect to carry a balance or pay in full.</li>
        <li>Include the annual fee and any typical cash withdrawals.</li>
        <li>Apply each card’s fees and rates to this pattern, using examples or calculators where available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This turns “which card is cheapest?” into a more concrete question:
        <em>“Which card costs less for the way I actually plan to use it?”</em>
        That is what many comparison tools and educational hubs try to help with.
